###Python: advances course

In this course, you will learn all aspects of the object-oriented approach in Python. Start with encapsulation and the interesting __slots__ keyword, and talk about why packages are needed and how to create your own virtual sandbox for a project in Python.

You'll treat a function as an object and learn how it's useful to the developer. In this section, the most important topic is decorators, which greatly simplify cross-functional code.

In the object life cycle module, you will learn how to create your own based on existing basic types and why you need it. Understand the questions of what happens, when and how an object is created and destroyed.

You will learn how to return to the system its resources that it lends to the developer, but he does not always give them back; see how this can be guaranteed with the context manager. You will add, subtract, and multiply user classes using Python's magic methods.

And at the end of the training, we will talk about how to hide the algorithm for bypassing data structures or generating data based on iterates, yield statements, and also consider ways to generate data structures using simplified Python syntax.
