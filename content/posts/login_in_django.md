In this tutorial, we will show you how to allow users to log into your site with their accounts and how to control what they can do and see based on whether they are logged in or not and their permissions. As part of this demo, we will expand the local library site by adding login and logout pages, as well as user and personal pages for viewing books that have been borrowed.
